#Job Count
---
This tool was created as a means of goal setting and time management.

The current iteration v1, is fairly simple
input the amount of "jobs" you need done as well as the amount hours
required.

Once entered, the output will return the suggested amount audit's that
should be completed per hour.

**Please Note**: The amount per hour is more of a suggestion, since there 
will always be edge cases. Not all jobs/audits/task/etc... are created 
the same. That said this tool should aid in managing productivity and 
reaching the larger goal. 

**Icebox**
The input might be refactored to have sliders for a more dynamic output for somemone to change the input to the appropriate time and setting.
    To further elaborate, if a someone has already elasped x amount of hours and x amount of task, they should have the option to adjust the output to know where they are compared to where they should be.
